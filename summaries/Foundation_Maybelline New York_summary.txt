Summary: The Doctor of Arts (D.A.; occasionally D.Arts or Art. from the Latin artium doctor) is a discipline-based terminal doctoral degree. It was originally conceived and designed to be an alternative to the traditional research-based Doctor of Philosophy. The D.A. is also frequently conferred as an honorary degree.

God! I am in love with this product. It's awesome all rounder phone & somewhat now my S22+ is sidelined. Comparison directly with S22+ : 1. Display: OP11 is more eye friendly & cherry on top is Dolby vision support so you are gonna enjoy multimedia consumption more on OP 11 than S22+ 2. Camera: S22+ will get a score of 10 but OP11 will bag 9 ( as front supports only 1080p). 3 Battery: OP 11 is clear winner you can rely on it as a daily driver with 100W charging support you don't have to worry for recharge. Recharges within 20 minutes when battery falls at 20%. 4. Performance: top notch is with OP 11 & OP 11 is clear winner 5. UI: Samsung is clear winner in this department. I would rate 10 while OP 11 will bag 9 for UI. 6. Value for money: OP 11 7. 5G & 4G network reception: OP 11 is way better than S22+ Call quality is clear on both in outdoor condition. 8. Speaker: OP 11 has more loud, clear & immersive speaker system. 9. IP rating: Samsung is clear winner 10. Wireless charging: Samsung has an edge but you will not feel it's loss since it is well supplemented by 100 W charger in the box. 11.

Then they inform me that that they will send a technician to inspect the phone after a week time as no technician is available before that. My old phone which I put on exchange was working perfectly, but when I ask to return me my old phone, the Amazon team has refuse to do that. This has caused me a good amount of trouble as now I am left without a phone. Also I have even not received my old phone full amount, Amazon has sent only 3600 out of 8600. This is very bad experience with Amazon return service. I should be given full 8600. This is very troublesome.

Then they inform me that that they will send a technician to inspect the phone after a week time as no technician is available before that. My old phone which I put on exchange was working perfectly, but when I ask to return me my old phone, the Amazon team has refuse to do that. This has caused me a good amount of trouble as now I am left without a phone. Also I have even not received my old phone full amount, Amazon has sent only 3600 out of 8600. This is very bad experience with Amazon return service. I should be given full 8600. This is very troublesome.I would recommend not buy this phone from Amazon as the phone built quality and performance is not good, If one should spend 62,000, a good phone was expected from Amazon and One Plus.

 iPhone 13:
 The iPhone 13 receives widespread acclaim for its remarkable features, especially during festive sales. Customers praise the device for its sleek design, vibrant Midnight color, and impressive A15 Bionic chip performance. The camera system, battery life, and Super Retina XDR display contribute to a satisfying user experience. Some users note a few drawbacks, including a minor heating issue and the absence of a charger. Overall, the iPhone 13 is highly recommended for those entering the Apple ecosystem or looking for a premium smartphone.
 

 iPhone 14 Pro:
 The iPhone 14 Pro, an upgrade for many, is recognized for its incredible camera capabilities, A16 Bionic chip, and the innovative Dynamic Island. Users appreciate the phone's performance, immersive display with ProMotion technology, and impressive sound quality. However, there are reports of heating issues during usage and concerns about the battery life. While the device is commended for its premium build and fluid interface, some suggest waiting for the iPhone 15 or opting for the larger 14 Pro Max for better battery life and display size.
 

 In conclusion, both the iPhone 13 and iPhone 14 Pro offer a premium smartphone experience, with the choice depending on individual preferences, budget considerations, and the desire for the latest features. Prospective buyers are encouraged to explore various reviews and prioritize their needs before making a purchase decision."

Display - The 60Hz refresh rate didn't felt badly form me cause i am used such kind of device before. - The brightness Range is so comfortable. - The 2160p60 HDR videos in youtube give blissful experiance Battery And charging - The charging time:- i took 1Hour to charge from 20% to 91% using apple 20w original adapter without any interruption - Battery backup - I am mostly maintain battery in btw 20% <-> 80% so i think this may get one day backup for me ,Average 5h screen on time - Little temperature warming while charging , no heating issue Perfomance - Good perfomance for video editing ,photography , social media . (I am not a gamer ) Camera - The cinematic Mode is mind Blowing . i missed 13 pro or higher varients for zooming in this mode . - Actually i really miss pro variant for the tele lens and camera features while i using this . Cost is wall for me. - The photos are nice and feature like exposure adjust and filter was good and quality photos . And the 5x zoomed photos is not good for me.it reduced the pixel quality . - The video and optical image stabilisation was mind blowing . i mostly explore on videos . it was soo good , no words other than that. AND THE BIGGEST FEAR FOR ME NOW IS IOS UPDATE i turned off the auto update at first place . i heared about DISPLAY ISSUES,HEATING ISSUES and BUGS in the ios updates for 13 and 14 series. So for expencive and established brand like apple does not fair . This is the only -ve i have to say as a reminder .Also i heared without ios update display issues are happened .

The S Pen functionality is widely appreciated, being described as fantastic and serving both creative and productivity purposes.
 

 While some users mention that the phone is a bit large, the majority find it comfortable to hold, and the design is considered premium and stylish.

 Oppo presents a mixed bag of reviews for its F23 5G model. While some users express satisfaction with timely delivery, good packaging, and the phone's features, others raise concerns about certain aspects.
 

 Positive feedback includes the phone's slim design, ultravolume mode for gamers, microscopic lens, and the impressive Supervooc charging, which, according to users, is exceptionally fast. The phone's sound quality, fingerprint sensor, and overall performance also receive favorable mentions.
 

 On the downside, there are reports of product damage upon delivery, incorrect chargers being provided, and issues with the camera quality. Some users express dissatisfaction with Oppo's charging time, suggesting a decrease in efficiency with prolonged use, as well as complaints about display issues.
 

 The F23 5G model is praised for its camera capabilities, particularly the microlens providing unique perspectives. However, there are concerns about the front camera's quality. Users appreciate the large internal memory of 256GB but express mixed opinions about the battery life, with some claiming it needs to be charged only once a day, while others complain about rapid depletion.
 

 In conclusion, the Oppo F23 5G appears to offer a mix of positive and negative experiences. While it boasts several commendable features, some users encounter issues related to product quality, charging efficiency, and camera performance. Prospective buyers may want to weigh these aspects carefully before making a purchase decision."

These wireless earbuds are an absolute delight to use, and here's why: First and foremost, the sound quality is outstanding. The Boat Airdopes deliver crisp, clear audio with impressive bass. Whether I'm listening to my favorite music or taking calls, the sound is immersive and enjoyable. I appreciate how well-balanced the audio is, allowing me to truly appreciate the details in each song. The design of the Boat Airdopes is sleek and stylish. They fit snugly in my ears and provide a comfortable wearing experience. The earbuds are lightweight and don't cause any discomfort, even during extended periods of use. Additionally, they come with different-sized ear tips, ensuring a perfect fit for anyone. The wireless connectivity is seamless, and the Bluetooth pairing process is quick and hassle-free. Once connected, the Boat Airdopes maintain a strong and stable connection without any audio dropouts. I can freely move around without worrying about signal loss, which is incredibly convenient. Battery life is also impressive. The Boat Airdopes provide a long-lasting listening experience, allowing me to enjoy my music throughout the day without the need for frequent recharging. The charging case is compact and portable, making it easy to carry around and providing additional battery backup when needed. One feature I particularly appreciate is the touch controls on the earbuds. They are intuitive and responsive, allowing me to play/pause music, adjust the volume, and answer/reject calls with just a few taps. I love the convenience and simplicity this provides, eliminating the need to constantly reach for my phone. The Boat Airdopes also offer water and sweat resistance, making them ideal for workouts and outdoor activities. I have used them during my workouts, and they have stayed securely in place while delivering excellent sound quality. Lastly, the price point of the Boat Airdopes is highly competitive, especially considering the features and quality they offer. It's a great value for the money, and I can confidently say that these earbuds are worth every penny. In conclusion, the Boat Airdopes have truly impressed me with their exceptional sound quality, comfortable fit, seamless connectivity, and user-friendly features.

 Customer reviews collectively provide a detailed perspective on the JBL Tune 230NC TWS earbuds, highlighting both positive and negative aspects. Users commend the product for its excellent sound quality, lightweight design, and effective noise cancellation. Positive feedback extends to the impressive battery life, seamless connectivity, and customizable features available through the JBL app. These qualities make the earbuds a value-for-money option, especially for music enthusiasts seeking a balanced sound profile with notable bass.
 

 However, the reviews also point out certain concerns, including occasional connectivity issues, discomfort during extended use, and suggestions for app optimization. Some users express dissatisfaction with the ANC performance, particularly in windy conditions. Additional recurring complaints involve the build quality of the case, occasional issues with the right earbud, and a desire for a more user-friendly app experience.

Prospective buyers should consider reported issues with build quality, occasional connectivity problems, and aspects related to comfort during prolonged usage.

Update: The right bud is facing issue it doesn't turn off even after in case. There are many who are facing this problem with right bud check google and youtube. DON'T BUY THESE EARPODS or you'll waste money. While researching for a good TWS with good ANC. I had two options. JBL 230NC and oneplus Z2. I opted for JBL as this is a brand built around sound and music. For a price tag of 5299, the sound was quite good. I like the sound good highs and lows, bass. You can customize it in the app. (Coming on the app later) The ANC worked very well. I commute alot in metro and traffic. It does a decent job of cutting off the audio, so you can hear your music without the sound of a child crying beside your seat. It also has aware mode and talk through mode also which is quite good. Aware mode disables ANC so you can hear the surrounding noise, good when you're walking beside a road or crossing it. Talk through mode also suppress the music playing and lets in extra noise from the outside. So it's making it easier to talk to someone without talking out your jbl tunes. But if there's wind then the mic let's in the wind sound to the point where you won't be able to listen anything else than the wind, making this feature useless. It should have a in-ear detection feature for this price. Coming to the app. Oh boy! Am I disappointed. I have a samsung galaxy s10 lite. The app is so so un optimized. It takes 10-15 sec to start the app and select my already paired tws. Even need to disconnect and connect bluetooth again. Then If i kill the app the tws starts behaving weird. It starts cutting off every 5 secs for like 2 secs. I start the app again and it fixes. Not always but not even that rarely. The range is so low that if you have one tws in your ear you cannot go to another room with the audio getting lagged every 5 seconds. The overall quantity of the product is not bad. Find my buds feature has helped me alot. I forget where my other bud is most of the time. The sound is pretty good. ANC is pretty good. Aware is good for safety. No call issues. Clear and crisp.

Pros: 1. Music lovers will surely love this earbud because the clarity was awesome with ample bass as well. Full volume doesnt make the sound dither. Its just superb. I used a preset eq using the app too and selected VOCAL to get that extra clarity. Other modes are available to try too. Also settings changed to Audio instead of normal or video. 2. Video lip sync - no complaint there too. All good 3. There is this ""talk thru"" under ambience mode which i used through the app and its amazing because once the ear bud is in the ear, naturally you will feel like ear is blocked from outside noise right? Put this talk thru option and instantly you will feel like a hole has been created within the buds and you can hear everything around you. Its amazing 4. Call clarity should be awesome because i used a lot for making calls, work related mainly and no one complained about anything from the other side. May be because of this, i havent tried noise cancellation too. Most of my calls were while in a cabin in office. 5. Battery backup seems to be top notch too since i have used to watch videos and for calls, it doesnt deplete just like that. Cons: 1. When playing music the pausing does incur a slight milli second delay. Whether you pause on the buds or on the phone. Same for changing tracks. The above are my findings so far. The buds fits well for me. When you see its shape we might have a feeling it wont but it will. Case is cute and not bulky too.

Call clarity should be awesome because i used a lot for making calls, work related mainly and no one complained about anything from the other side.May be because of this,",Battery,0.0,"Battery backup seems to be top notch too since i have used to watch videos and for calls, it doesnt deplete just like that.",Product_Quality,1.0,When playing music the pausing does incur a slight milli second delay. Whether you pause on the buds or on the phone. Same for changing tracks. The above are my findings so far. The buds fits well for me. When you see its shape we might have a feeling it wont but it will.Case is cute and not bulky too.,Feedback,0.0,"Overall, its just awesome for the price and you get JBL signature sound too.",1,

Excellent sound, has good bass, using with my Realme GT master Edition. ANC (5/5) The best thing about this is the ANC. It almost cancels all the noise out when you turn ANC. Another best feature is that we can switch between Ambient ANC, which does not filter all the noises. This feature is given when we are listening to music while walking on road to listen to oncoming vehicles. Connectivity (5/5) Connectivity is awesome, audio and video sync is excellent without any delay, tried in Netflix and Youtube. Calls (5/5) Coming to the calls, the audio is very clear when someone calls. Even voice from mic of TWS is excellent and can be heard to receiver's end without any distortion. Music (5/5) I listen to lot of music, and the quality is just out of the world. Has a dedicated equilizer in app, and can be tweaked around. Has proper Bass effect required for music, not over powering though. Overall Best for Music no doubt about. It is JBL after all. Comfort (5/5) I bought TWS 230 initially and returned it because of discomfort. Then I bought 130 TWS. Comfort wise I did not find any ear pain or discomfort even after wearing it for long time. The only problem is you cant hear the outside world if ANC is turned on. Its so good. For my Ear it fits perfectly medium sized ears. Battery (5/5) I charge the case once in a week for 10 mins. The case charges very fast with my phone charger. Cons The only Con is found is the case. The Lid on the case is bit loose. It can break easily if the case falls on the floor. Also Frequent opening of the Lid on the case makes the spring/ screw loose. Another con is that I was not able to find a pouch for this model anywhere. Then i had order from third party website. If you get it for 3.8k then definitely go for it. 230 NC also has same quality music, but has a bigger battery.

Pros: 1. Aesthetically appealing 2. ANC reduces surrounding noise by at least 30% (when nothing is playing) and by up to 80% when something is playing. 3. The simple touch function for switching between tracks and turning ANC on/off is useful. 4. The software allows you to create the gesture, which works well. 5. There is no doubt about the built quality. 6. Mics are perfect no problem in calling Cons: 1. It is not possible to connect to two devices at the same time. 2. Reconnecting to your other device takes time; there is no quick switch. 3. The app in the phone only works when linked to the phone; however, you cannot use the app while connected to the laptop. 3. It's difficult to use with your helmet on. Things to keep in mind: 1. If you are moving from a neck band or another device, it will take some time to adapt to this(Any earbuds in this case) 2. Without a protective case, the chance of dropping from your hand is always significant. (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B0B6PXLY2V/ref=ewc_pr_img_1?smid=A1S458YIMPYL70&psc=1) 3.

Did an extensive review before looking to buy a new pair. 1. It's not a great fit. Perhaps all ear buds suffer from this problem. I have to use small size silicon cover to fit. Yet it doesn't feel 100% re assuring. But manageable. 2. Sound quality is clean. Like most reviews said I felt the sound Signature is very neutral. It's good. Almost feel like a low cost audiophile ear buds 3. The app and eq is what does the custom trick. Keep tweaking the eq to hit your sweet spot. And the keep changing as per the gernre. It's. Task but the only way to listen to a variety of music . 4. The mids is general are very crisp. Bass as reviews by many as crisp. It is not. It's just a lean and near bass. Will have to change the eq for a good base profile. 5. These are great for the price point. I guess one can never compare it with a 10k+ ear buds.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71lZElLPO+L._SY88.jpg,Product_Quality,1,It's not a great fit. Perhaps all ear buds suffer from this problem.

Firstly I wanted to thank Geeky Ranjit for the review of this earphone. I got the confidence to buy it because he recommended it. I first ordered the Nothing ear 1 but I cancelled it because I saw a lot of people complaining about the bugs in that earphone. Then I decided to go with pixel buds A series. Those are some good earphones but lack ANC and other features like an equaliser in the app. Thankfully, I ordered this earphone. I overall found this value for money. I got it for around 5k after all discount. 130NC and 230NC ideally both are the same but I like the stem design so I ordered this one. If you receive a lot of calls then blindly go for this superb call quality with no issues found on the other side. Let's talk about the pro and cons. Pros: 1. These are really good sounding earphones very well balanced. 2. App is extremely good you can customise almost every thing. 3. ANC is good at this price point I can’t expect more but definitely a plus point. 4. Very light and comfortable. 5. Call quality is definitely like Apple Airpods Cons 1.

Bass is awesome. 4. Vocals and mids are also clear.",Battery,0,Battery backup is good.,Performance,1.0,"App feels laggy sometimes. 2. Works great with smart phone, but not with PC and Macbook.Other imp bad observations: 1. The earphone which you picked out first of the case, drains battery faster than other. I guess it becomes master and deals with various communication/encryption/decryption/ etc related things, hence battery drains faster. 2. Battery backup is very bad with Macbook.

A total segment killer. It has got awesome sound clarity with good bass and low mid responses along with a good and clear treble section. You can equalise the sound as per your needs from the JBL Headphones App that you can download from Playstore or ITunes Store. You can even edit the touch responses from volume control to media control or ANC control using the app. The noise cancellation feature is spot on and this provides 3 different modes of noise cancellation. Charging and battery longevity is really good. Doesn't feel uneasy to wear and doesn't fall off the ears or something. I'd recommend this product to everyone who's looking for a great Bluetooth earphone set in this price range.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61L64I07BEL._SY88.jpg,Cost,0,this is a premium product for it's price range.

I ordered a Air Pod Pro gen 2 - from Appario Retail.. .....and recieved a 1) opened and resealed box (apple seal off, scotch tape on) 2) dirty internal package 3) scrathed/buffed charging case 4) clearly used air pods with ear wax on them! 5) Not only that, its got a missing ear bud (the fresh silicon ones). I tried to put in a repalcement request, and I've been on hold over the phone for an hour since Amazon doesnt allow for a straight through return/ replacement in apple's case, AND the teams been working hard to let me know that I have a ""good product"" and I shouldnt bother about the reused bit (their words not mine), and if I do insist, the only option is to go to Apple Store for a ""resolution"" .

 The Samsung Galaxy Buds Live have received mixed reviews from customers, showcasing both positive and negative experiences. Many users appreciate the earbuds' sound quality, especially in the open-ear design, offering a unique and immersive experience. The bass is praised for its thump, and the clarity in calls and music is highlighted. The earbuds are noted for their comfortable fit for some users, while others find them uncomfortable, especially for long durations.
 

 On the downside, the noise cancellation feature receives varied opinions, with some users stating it's subtle and effective for minimal frequencies, while others find it lacking, especially in comparison to other products. Connectivity appears to be an issue for some users, reporting short-range connections, occasional disconnections, and difficulties with different devices.
 

 The design and build quality of the earbuds and case receive positive comments for their premium feel. However, some users report issues with the case, such as losing caps and difficulties in opening.
 

 Battery life is generally appreciated, with longer durations reported when noise cancellation is turned off. The Samsung Galaxy Buds Live seem to work well with Samsung devices, offering a seamless experience, but connectivity issues with other brands are noted.
 

 In conclusion, the Samsung Galaxy Buds Live offer a unique open-ear design, excellent sound quality, and comfort for some users. However, concerns about noise cancellation effectiveness, connectivity issues, and occasional discomfort for certain individuals should be considered before making a purchase. The product is seen as a good value, particularly when obtained at a discounted price during sales."

 The Samsung Galaxy Buds Live have received mixed reviews from customers, showcasing both positive and negative experiences. Many users appreciate the earbuds' sound quality, especially in the open-ear design, offering a unique and immersive experience. The bass is praised for its thump, and the clarity in calls and music is highlighted. The earbuds are noted for their comfortable fit for some users, while others find them uncomfortable, especially for long durations.
 

 On the downside, the noise cancellation feature receives varied opinions, with some users stating it's subtle and effective for minimal frequencies, while others find it lacking, especially in comparison to other products. Connectivity appears to be an issue for some users, reporting short-range connections, occasional disconnections, and difficulties with different devices.
 

 The design and build quality of the earbuds and case receive positive comments for their premium feel. However, some users report issues with the case, such as losing caps and difficulties in opening.
 

 Battery life is generally appreciated, with longer durations reported when noise cancellation is turned off. The Samsung Galaxy Buds Live seem to work well with Samsung devices, offering a seamless experience, but connectivity issues with other brands are noted.
 

 In conclusion, the Samsung Galaxy Buds Live offer a unique open-ear design, excellent sound quality, and comfort for some users. However, concerns about noise cancellation effectiveness, connectivity issues, and occasional discomfort for certain individuals should be considered before making a purchase. The product is seen as a good value, particularly when obtained at a discounted price during sales."

I purchased this with doubt as it's the first generation of wireless ear buds from samsung. Actually it's very good! I used to for 2+ weeks and I'll list down the pros and cons. Pros: ● Very clear even with bass boost ● Comfortable in ear headphone ● Wireless charging support. Works very well with Samsung wireless charging pad and reverse wireless charging on my Galaxy S21 FE. ● Decent ANC, could cut out AC noise, rain noise and any other constant noise. ● Intelligent led indicators to indicate battery levels. ● Long battery life. For me it lasted around 4 hours with ANC and 6+ hours without ANC. ● Seamless connection with Galaxy devices. You don't even need to turn on Bluetooth, just press the connect button and it does everything for you after installing setup. ● Microphone quality is great.

Drum Rolls.... Before I express my utter candid views about the product, I'd like to thank the ""seller"" and ""Amazon"" for making this product available online and delivering it on time. Honestly I think I'd be happier if Samsung sold me a piece of rock with their logo on it, that way I'd be sure and content knowing that the rock is useless and it doesn't come with any exaggerated claims. Unfortunately Samsung sold me a failed product, and I can see Samsung laughing at me like ""Skeletor"" from ""He-Man"". Now, about the product It just disconnects, and disconnects, and disconnects... I tried using it with my Galaxy S10 mini, LG G8X, S20, Tab S6, Samsung Smart TV, ROG Desktop, Laptop and more, it disconnected with every device. I guess Samsung really wanted to test its potential to make something so unstable that the most unstable element in the periodic table looks far stable than Galaxy buds live, and guess what, they succeeded with flying colors. The product's audio quality isn't great too, it is mid heavy. Everytime I listen to it, it feels as if ""AKG Audio"" wanted to be better than ""Bose"", but eventually settled for ""Shriram Audio, every rickshaw driver's dream audio"". Its noise canceling feature is an added gimmick, with its noise canceling ""On"" one can probably hear an astronaut landing on moon. Due to all the issues described above, I recently got the product replaced too, but unfortunately all the issues still remain. Sumsung does give you good service, but it should be the last thing one should consider before buying a product. And when it comes to Galaxy Buds Live, definitely stay away... I owned the first generation galaxy buds and they too went bad quite soon, their battery degraded in about 6 months of usage. Moral of the Story Samsung can make good phones, but they can't make good audio products probably ever, and when you see a Samsung audio product next time, buy a piece of ""Rock""...",https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81pyu4+ty2L._SY88.jpg,Network,1,"Unfortunately, Samsung sold me a failed product, and I can see Samsung laughing at me like ""Skeletor"" from ""He-Man"".

Honestly speaking these pairs of Buds Live slowly practised to fitting my ears, this is something between inear and on ear. After couple of updates these Buddies started giving me mindblowing quality of Sound! With super Bass, Felt premium is premium!!! So this like A.R.Rahman new song which becomes hit slowly. Gaming mode gives u awesome low latency, but no use of it, as Indian Gov Banned PUBG. True Drawbacks: It gives the best loud sound only at Max volume, equalizer normal is Good, others making the loudness down. Sound breaks frequently when you connect ur device in 5Ghz Wifi, fixed when connected to 2Ghz. So if you kinda guys keep thinking to spend 15K for this Buds confused sleepless nights pls stay away. If you kinda freaking Gadget buyer trying all new products go for it!! Final Verdict: Buds Live will changes ur life with a super new experience!

Latest Hardware - 13th Gen i5 13420H processor coupled with a 4050 75W graphics card. Comes with 16 GB DDR5 ram & 512 GB Gen 4 SSD (usable - around 450 GB).

Keyboard - Single colour (white) illuminated keyboard. The feedback is very good. I don't know whether these are Cons but let me still mention them : 1. Battery Life - Average, to be honest. My personal opinion if you want to save more power would be to decrease the refresh rate & brightness. But it is better to plug in & use the laptop, if you're at your home.

Display Brightness: Could have been a tad bit on the brighter side. But not a deal breaker, for sure. 3. Camera Quality: Just a basic camera, seriously! Don't have high hopes in this regard. 4. No MS OFFICE - This was a bummer (for me). Sitting on the fence : Build Quality: It is neither a rugged, rough and tough laptop nor absolutely brittle.

 The Acer Nitro V emerges as a strong contender in the gaming laptop market, delivering exceptional performance and value for its price. Users have praised its sleek appearance, powerful hardware, and impressive gaming capabilities. The laptop, equipped with a 13th Gen i5 13420H processor and a 4050 75W graphics card, handles a variety of AAA games effortlessly.
 

 Pros highlighted by users include the laptop's appealing design, robust hardware specifications, including 16 GB DDR5 RAM and a 512 GB Gen 4 SSD, and the surprisingly good quality of its speakers. The thermal performance has been commendable, even during extended gaming sessions, with minimal heating reported. Additionally, the laptop is relatively lightweight, making it suitable for on-the-go gaming.
 

 Some users noted potential drawbacks, such as average battery life, a display brightness that could be slightly improved, and a basic camera quality. The absence of pre-installed MS Office and the subjective build quality left a few users on the fence. However, many found these to be minor concerns compared to the overall package.
 

 User experiences with customer service and technical support varied. While some praised the quick and easy resolution process, others faced challenges with defective products and delays in technician visits.
 

 In terms of pricing, users expressed satisfaction, asserting that as long as the laptop remains under 80k, it is a worthwhile investment, offering great value for the features it provides. Some noted that the laptop was purchased during a sale, further enhancing its cost-effectiveness.
 

 In conclusion, the Acer Nitro V stands out as a budget-friendly gaming laptop that delivers excellent performance, impressive thermals, and a sleek design. While some users faced challenges with customer support and specific features, the majority found it to be a compelling choice within its price range, especially when acquired during promotional events. For gamers on a tight budget, the Acer Nitro V is deemed a steal, offering a powerful gaming experience with a few minor compromises."

 Pros highlighted by users include the laptop's appealing design, robust hardware specifications, including 16 GB DDR5 RAM and a 512 GB Gen 4 SSD, and the surprisingly good quality of its speakers. The thermal performance has been commendable, even during extended gaming sessions, with minimal heating reported. Additionally, the laptop is relatively lightweight, making it suitable for on-the-go gaming.
 

 Some users noted potential drawbacks, such as average battery life, a display brightness that could be slightly improved, and a basic camera quality. The absence of pre-installed MS Office and the subjective build quality left a few users on the fence. However, many found these to be minor concerns compared to the overall package.
 

 User experiences with customer service and technical support varied. While some praised the quick and easy resolution process, others faced challenges with defective products and delays in technician visits.
 

 In terms of pricing, users expressed satisfaction, asserting that as long as the laptop remains under 80k, it is a worthwhile investment, offering great value for the features it provides. Some noted that the laptop was purchased during a sale, further enhancing its cost-effectiveness.
 

 In conclusion, the Acer Nitro V stands out as a budget-friendly gaming laptop that delivers excellent performance, impressive thermals, and a sleek design. While some users faced challenges with customer support and specific features, the majority found it to be a compelling choice within its price range, especially when acquired during promotional events. For gamers on a tight budget, the Acer Nitro V is deemed a steal, offering a powerful gaming experience with a few minor compromises."

I ordered the product on 8th October & received it on 17th. Let me go through the pros of the laptop: 1. Looks - Not one person has had any negative remark on the appearance of my laptop. 2. Latest Hardware - 13th Gen i5 13420H processor coupled with a 4050 75W graphics card. Comes with 16 GB DDR5 ram & 512 GB Gen 4 SSD (usable - around 450 GB). Upgradable RAM & SSD - Upto 32 GB & 2 TB respectively. 3. Speaker Quality - The sound quality of the speakers was surprisingly good. 4. Thermals - Faced no issues as of yet. Watch this space - will update after proper gaming. 5. Weight - Not very lightweight but yes relatively lightweight if one directly compares with a conventional gaming laptop. 5. Keyboard - Single colour (white) illuminated keyboard. The feedback is very good. I don't know whether these are Cons but let me still mention them : 1. Battery Life - Average, to be honest. My personal opinion if you want to save more power would be to decrease the refresh rate & brightness. But it is better to plug in & use the laptop, if you're at your home. It helps the laptop in the long run. And do not run any game without plugging in the charger. It will kill your battery sooner than you can imagine. 2. Display Brightness: Could have been a tad bit on the brighter side. But not a deal breaker, for sure. 3. Camera Quality: Just a basic camera, seriously! Don't have high hopes in this regard. 4. No MS OFFICE - This was a bummer (for me). Sitting on the fence : Build Quality: It is neither a rugged, rough and tough laptop nor absolutely brittle. The lid & keyboard flex were as minimal as it can be. Personally, for me, the build quality is pretty decent.

So the review is written while keeping in mind the price point and only focused on gaming. Now, Let's get down to the nitty-gritty. Games Tested: Counter-Strike 2 , Valorant, RDR2, Hogwarts Legacy, TLoU, FH5. The Good Stuff: 1. **Gaming Whiz**: Your can play almost all recent AAA games @ 1080p Ultra at medium to high fps. With DLSS 3 Frame generation you can easily double your fps with minimal loss to the visual fidelity (Only available on RTX 40 Series gpus). So that you can finally take advantage of the ""RTX ON"" settings . The laptop doesn't come with a MUX switch which is a must for any decent gaming laptops. But you can compensate for that by connenting your external monitor through the HDMI port which connects directly to the GPU. You will notice the difference in FPS in games like Valorant. The 6gb VRAM is a great add on as most laptops in this segment only provide you with a measly 4gb of VRAM (let me tell you, this is a pretty big deal and can be a deal breaker as games are becoming more and more vram hungry day by day. Hogwarts Legacy and TloU, I am looking at you.) 2. **Cool Customer**: Now the laptop performs great in gaming, but how about the thermals? *Spoiler Alert* : Even after long gaming marathons, this thing stays cooler than the other side of the pillow. Hats off to the thermals – Don't know how but Acer managed to cool this puppy down with the 2 fans and the 2 exhausts, both on a single side of the laptop. * Dell G15, take notes. * *Pro Tip* : Always keep the laptop plugged in while gaming and turn on the gaming mode (you can keep fan control to auto). The fans remain super quiet under normal usage but as soon as you hit 60s the fans go hard ( and i mean SUPER hard and you can feel the sound and rumble). If you're a mad man you get an option to put max speed. This unlocks the full potential of the laptop, although I don't recommend it. Rather, put a FPS cap on in the Nvidia settings and game at a consistent smooth FPS. 3. **Slim & Svelte**: A gaming laptop that doesn't double as a dumbbell. It's pretty lightweight at just 2.1 kg, making it great for gaming on the go or lugging to LAN parties or as your travel buddy in your short or long trips. 4. **Keyboard Bliss**: Typing on this thing feels like a dream. The keys are responsive, which makes it not just great for gaming but also everyday typing tasks. 5. **Roomy Trackpad**: Surprisingly, the trackpad is quite large, and the gestures work like a charm. It's got that smooth operator feel. The Not-So-Good: 1. **Meh Build Quality**: To keep the price down, Acer had to make some compromises on build quality. It's not super premium, but it does the job. 2. **Battery Blues**: With a 57WH battery, you can't expect it to last through a gaming session (even half) without plugging in. Keep the charger handy and get yourself a USB- C PD charger to use on the go. 3. ** Same old Display **: Yes, that same old Acer Nitro trademarked 144Hz 250 nits brightness IPS lcd panel, nothing to write home about. Terrible viewing angles but atleast the colors and saturations are okay. Just get a good external monitor. And in the ""Well, That's Interesting"" Department: - The 16 GB DDR5 RAM comes in a single-channel setup, which might not be everyone's cup of tea. Also, it's clocked at 4800 MHz, not the advertised 5200 MHz (Although it does support it). Here is the scoop - Get another 16gb on the second slot and you have 32gigs of RAM.

So, Guys my genuine review for this laptop is I was searching for laptop with specifications of I5 12500h with 3050 and I got G15 in ~₹60k and with this price point I thought this is best deal I'm getting compared to Nitro5 and Tuf and till 5-6 Aug Lenovo Tuf was not available so I purchased This. After getting delivery on 6 August I encountered with it's first error at time of System Setup laptop was unable to detect It's battery it was working only on plug in mode. And i was totally frustrated 🥴 with this product after calling service centre and they replaced the battery in next 3-5 working days. And after service it was working fine untill I found one more issue of (blue screen)unexpected error occurred while keeping my pc on sleep. Still figuring out how to fix this. After 10-15 days of use dell showed it's power a black line occured on screen and again service guy came and replaced the whole screen panel and he said it was occured due to wire cut of display cabel I dont know how the hell a wire which is tucked perfectly can be cut. And still I'm facing heat issues software glitches and many more....... One more important message this laptop does not comes with extra ssd slot dell is misguiding us saying they have one extra ssd 2 slot but when I opened the back panel there was no slot at all. Scam by dell saying upgradable ssd slot. If I just see pros of this laptop its way better than any other under this price whether it is it's performance or playing games doing heavy task it manages everything well. . Sound quality ease of use everything is good. My suggestion is if you are buying this laptop go for Loq or Nitro 5 they are best in segment.

I bought it majorly for Video Editing and Graphics work along with Coding Soft Like Anaconda and MATLAB. This laptop is smooth as it has 16Gigs of ram with i5 12th gen and it rendered a 4k Video of 6mins long in Just 3 min 40 seconds. I didn't do gaming but I'm pretty sure it'll handle cause of the RTX 3050. Pros: 1. better performance with 16Gb Ram and RTX 3050. 2. HP Omen is helping in managing Performance. 3. Good Brightness of Display but if you're an graphic designer you'll need an sRGB External Display. 4. Good Speaker ( Install B&O drivers if you're facing any issue). 5. Comes with 200W Charger, so it charges pretty quickly. 6. Has Good Trackpad Area. 7. Key Dist. is Good So No Prblm In Typing. 8. Handles the Thermal very well and you can optimize the fan Using OMEN Gaming Hub. Cons : 1. No Levels of Backlit Keyboard. 2. Slightly Heaver. 3. Low Battery Life (High Performance Mode). 4.

I've been able to get around 4-5 days on a single charge with moderate use, including frequent heart rate monitoring and notifications. Charging is relatively quick, so you're not without yourdevice for too long. Connectivity and Compatibility (4/5): The Bluetooth connectivity is stable, and it pairs easily with both Android and iOS devices. The smartphone app is user-friendly and provides comprehensive insights into your health data.

The Fire-boltt Phoenix Amoled Edition smartwatch is a dazzling piece of technology that effortlessly blends style and functionality. Its stunning AMOLED screen, framed by almost imperceptible bezels, is a visual treat, offering vibrant colors and sharp details. The fast charging feature ensures you spend more time enjoying its beauty than tethered to a charger. Wearing the Fire-boltt Phoenix is a tactile delight as it fits comfortably on the wrist, making it a true fashion statement. The user-friendly interface makes it a breeze to navigate, catering to both tech-savvy and novice users alike. However, the Achilles' heel of this smartwatch lies in its battery life, which falls short when compared to others in the same price range. On a full charge, it manages approximately 36 hours, even less when connected to your phone for Bluetooth calling. The sleep timer's inaccuracy might be a minor annoyance for those tracking their slumber. While the Fire-boltt Phoenix offers a heart sensor and SpO2 readings, its reliability falters when it comes to blood pressure measurements. It's essential to use this watch for its other features, appreciating its style, beautiful display, and ease of use, but perhaps relying on a dedicated medical device for health data.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/714LvW7GIaL._SY88.jpg,Product_Quality,0,"Its stunning AMOLED screen, framed by almost imperceptible bezels, is a visual treat, offering vibrant colors and sharp details.",Battery,0,The fast charging feature ensures you spend more time enjoying its beauty than tethered to a charger.,User_Interface,0.0,"Wearing the Fire-boltt Phoenix is a tactile delight as it fits comfortably on the wrist, making it a true fashion statement.

 The Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 has garnered generally positive feedback, praised for its impressive design, vibrant AMOLED display, and seamless integration with Samsung Galaxy devices. Users appreciate the advanced health and fitness tracking capabilities, including ECG and blood pressure monitoring, along with real-time coaching for maintaining an active lifestyle.
 

 While the LTE activation process is swift, and compatibility with apps like Google Maps is lauded, the rotating bezel, though stylish, may trap dust over time. Strap quality receives mixed opinions, with concerns about durability and difficulty in detachment and attachment.
 

 A notable concern revolves around battery life, with varying user experiences. Some achieve up to 1.5 days on a charge, while others express dissatisfaction with faster drainage, particularly under heavy usage. The slow charging time, taking around 2 hours, is also criticized.
 

 Opinions on the transition to Wear OS from Tizen are mixed, and fitness enthusiasts find inaccuracies in GPS tracking, heart rate monitoring, and body composition readings. Sleep tracking is reported to be subpar, and returning faulty products poses challenges in customer support.
 

 Despite these issues, users highlight the watch's accuracy, AMOLED display, and smooth touch response. Compatibility for Samsung Galaxy users is emphasized, while non-Samsung users may encounter limitations.
 

 In conclusion, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 offers a top-notch smartwatch experience with style, functionality, and health-tracking features. While the mixed reviews highlight concerns about battery life and fitness accuracy, the positive aspects make it a compelling choice for those seeking a comprehensive smartwatch experience. Potential buyers are advised to carefully consider their priorities before making a purchase."

Some queries i want to solve looking at reviews, people don't know something so they just try to return it on amazon and if they can't they just put a bad review in frustration. 1) Imported watch? If you're buying 'discounted watch' here means the cost is less than the Samsung's original price then definitely that watch is imported from uae or anywhere but that doesn't affect anything. Buy from Appario instead if you want indian version, change the seller please. 2) Battery life? Do you have a smartphone which can work for 7 days in a single charge, no? There's no true smartwatch ever made in the entire world which have a battery life of more than 48 hours. I'm talking about ios and Android os only (even the latest apple series 7 works for 12hours max only in a single charge with normal usage) so that's a thing, you have to charge it daily for approx 1.5 hours like you charge your smartphone.

Some queries i want to solve looking at reviews, people don't know something so they just try to return it on amazon and if they can't they just put a bad review in frustration. 1) Imported watch? If you're buying 'discounted watch' here means the cost is less than the Samsung's original price then definitely that watch is imported from uae or anywhere but that doesn't affect anything. Buy from Appario instead if you want indian version, change the seller please.",Battery,1.0,"2) Battery life? Do you have a smartphone which can work for 7 days in a single charge, no? There's no true smartwatch ever made in the entire world which have a battery life of more than 48 hours. I'm talking about ios and Android os only (even the latest apple series 7 works for 12hours max only in a single charge with normal usage) so that's a thing, you have to charge it daily for approx 1.5 hours like you charge your smartphone. I'll add more things here in future.",,,,,,,1,

 Customers have shared diverse opinions on the Apple Watch SE 2, offering insights into its strengths and drawbacks. The general consensus appreciates the sleek design, quality display, and extensive features of the watch, making it a great addition, especially at its price point.
 

 Positive remarks focus on the watch's aesthetics, comfortable fit, and compatibility with Apple's ecosystem. Users find the watch suitable for daily use, fitness tracking, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. The seamless integration with iPhones is highlighted, emphasizing the convenience of managing settings directly from the phone.
 

 However, a common concern is the battery life, with mixed experiences reported. While some find it sufficient for a day or more, others express disappointment, suggesting the need for daily charging. Charging speed is generally noted as acceptable, but the battery's longevity remains a notable consideration.
 

 Fitness tracking features, including workout modes and heart rate monitoring, are praised, but there are occasional criticisms regarding accuracy in sleep measurement. The absence of certain advanced health features like ECG and oxygen monitoring in the SE model is mentioned, but this limitation is generally accepted given the lower price point.
 

 The device's performance, user interface, and call quality are commended, with users finding it responsive and efficient in handling various tasks. Some drawbacks include difficulty in downloading music from third-party apps and the absence of support from third-party retailers for certain users.
 

 Despite some negative feedback, the Apple Watch SE 2 appears to be a popular choice for those entering the Apple ecosystem or seeking a reliable and functional smartwatch without the premium price tag. The mixed reviews highlight considerations such as battery life and feature preferences, encouraging potential buyers to carefully evaluate their needs before making a purchase."

Reasons to buy: If you are a first-time Apple Watch user, this model can provide you with important data to determine if you really need an Apple Watch or not. This model has enough features to help you determine if you love or hate the product, so there's no need to buy the top-spec watch right away.

Reasons not to buy: If you do not like to charge another device, this may not be the best option for you. However, the watch can easily last a whole day on a single charge.

It boasts a bright, crisp display that is easy to read even in bright sunlight. The watch is also incredibly snappy and responsive, with a speedy processor that makes using the device a joy. The taptic engine is another standout feature, providing precise and subtle haptic feedback for notifications and alerts. One of the key selling points of the Apple Watch SE 2 is its calling capabilities, and it does not disappoint. The sound clarity for both incoming and outgoing calls is excellent, and the watch seamlessly integrates with your iPhone to make and receive calls without needing to take your phone out of your pocket. However, one of the main drawbacks of the Apple Watch SE 2 is its battery life, which lasts only about a day on a single charge. This can be frustrating for those who want to use the watch all day without needing to recharge it. Another issue with the Apple Watch SE 2 is the difficulty some users experience in downloading songs from Spotify. Apple recommends using Apple Music instead, but this may not be ideal for users who prefer Spotify. Additionally, some users have reported difficulty finding support for the device from third-party retailers such as Amazon. Overall, the Apple Watch SE 2 is an excellent device for those looking for a high-quality smartwatch with calling capabilities and a responsive, snappy interface.

Watch: This is an acceptable product in this price range (bought for 2499/-). Design is smooth, material look durable and good quality. (It seems manufacturer is determined to copy apple watch style). Minimum functions. Sports mode has around 8 options (NO SWIM MODE, even though they boast it is IP68). Screen size is ok with good clarity. Battery seems holding as they claim (I have not activated automatic heart rate monitor, may be thats a reason battery holding). So if you are looking for a show piece or imitating smart watch, this is an ideal choice Application (NoiseFit ios variant): Worse than worst mobile app as of now. I have no postive comment regarding app. It was easy to install at around 120 MB, but pairing with watch is difficult, it takes ages to pair and some time not even pairing even though app detect the watch. Now when it get paired I cant sync any data from watch to mobile. When try to manually sync, its just shows *syncing* but nothing happens. So what use of smart watch if you cant record and sync data?!!!. Another issue with app is downloading watch faces. Only on initial pairing time I was able to download a watch face,(The app shows lot of cool dial faces, but what use if you cant USE them ??)remaining time when i tried in app it just shows *downloading ... 0%*, what nonsense is this, i mean if you are launching a product, make sure atleast it works properly and do what you market it will do. For last one week i tried installing/uninstalling app, restarting mob, pairing/unpairing/forgeting device but data syncing was possible only one time that also for a session. Very bad application/interface/watch firmware or whatever it is. So if you are buying smart watch for logging your activities and monitoring exercise regime, better dont buy this product. You can have a mi band for less price with loaded functions and a smooth application. Customer care: Initially raised a complaint for data syncing inability and what they did was forwarding a technical FAQ link for all their product. Being a tech pro, i had already applied all of their troubleshooting options so i replied that Problem persist, at last a customercare officer called and unfortunately i was entering a lift with boss, so told her to please call after 10 minutes. I tried to call back the number afterwards but it was not connecting. Believe me they called back again but even before ringing, disconnected the call and immediately came an sms stating they were not able to reach my number!!!, literally i was waiting for the call and i saw their number just flashing and disconnecting even before attending the call..!!!, speechless at the customer service of Noise, may be those customer care executives might be getting lots of call as they churn out product after product and people raising complaints after complaints. Winding up: Watch is good looking and smooth, but interface is very very bad coupled with strange customer care response.

So if you are looking for a show piece or imitating smart watch, this is an ideal choice Application (NoiseFit ios variant): Worse than worst mobile app as of now. I have no postive comment regarding app. It was easy to install at around 120 MB, but pairing with watch is difficult, it takes ages to pair and some time not even pairing even though app detect the watch. Now when it get paired I cant sync any data from watch to mobile. When try to manually sync, its just shows *syncing* but nothing happens. So what use of smart watch if you cant record and sync data?!!!. Another issue with app is downloading watch faces. Only on initial pairing time I was able to download a watch face,(The app shows lot of cool dial faces, but what use if you cant USE them ??)remaining time when i tried in app it just shows *downloading ... 0%*, what nonsense is this, i mean if you are launching a product, make sure atleast it works properly and do what you market it will do. For last one week i tried installing/uninstalling app, restarting mob, pairing/unpairing/forgeting device but data syncing was possible only one time that also for a session. Very bad application/interface/watch firmware or whatever it is. So if you are buying smart watch for logging your activities and monitoring exercise regime, better dont buy this product.

It has been one month of daily use and have had no complaints till now. Although I did face some issues syncing the phone and the watch in the initial few days. But a few restarts did the job. All the features work fine. I have also noticed that whenever there is a delayed alert on the watch it is mostly due to network issues or if the phone is away from the watch. The watch is not to be blamed. At times, I get notifications a sec earlier than the phone. The feature of replying back to calls with template msgs is only available in noise watches I think. I also have a Boat xtend and it only has the feature to reject calls. The green colour is actually a dull green colour so unless you are sure about the colour don't buy a green one since you won't have an option to return it only bcos u don't like the colour. However, A FEEDBACK FOR THE MAKERS - THERE IS NO REASON WHY NOISE PULSE should HAVE LESS WATCHFACES THAN YOUR OTHER MODELS. Update your user manual and make it easier for those who are using a SMARTWATCH for the first time. Your user manual does not state anything about how to sync it with the phone to get notifications etc. One has to figure it out on the app with trail and error method. It took me a whole day to sync the phone with the watch and figure out what was going wrong. In the end, No electronic gadget is perfect. If you are looking for something near perfect then buy an Apple watch. Else Noise pulse and similar other models are certainly a good buy.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71fHlfQwUQL._SY88.jpg,Network,1,"Although I did face some issues syncing the phone and the watch in the initial few days.

I Use it for running on concrete and staircase running. Sole is very soft and no shoe bite. Shoe body is stable. Covered 250kms so far and shoe is as good as new. 18th May The left rubber sole has been developing a hole and now the hole is through and through.

Answer is yes. In regular practice our gas cylinder goes for 1 month + 1 to 3 days. But in this new stove it goes for 1 month + 10 to 13 days Well I have added many images both in still & running condition for references. If u look carefully in low flame position also the flame reaches to the utensil quite easily & covers enough to heat quite easily & faster. I believe this is where it saves gas (eventually reducing overall cooking time). But if u prefer to do some slow cooking, kindly stay away from this gas stove, u will burn the food. Apart from this, the pot holder/stand has pin fixing type, so it holds quite well. I have seen many new stoves where there are some kind of flower slots, but because of the gap/tolerance the stands slides/rotates a bit. Another negative point could be, the stand's 4 legs are not in same plane in some cases, so you may find that the utensil is standing on 3 legs only, but that's OK. It will not fall down.

Positive comments mention the stylish appearance, lightweight design, and smooth wheels, making the bags suitable for short trips. Some customers appreciate the brand's reputation and find the products value for money. However, several complaints revolve around issues of poor build quality, damages upon delivery, broken components like wheels and zippers, and difficulties in obtaining warranty services. Some users express disappointment with the size, durability, and overall quality of the bags. While there are instances of satisfaction, the company may need to address concerns related to product durability, packaging, and customer service for a more consistent and positive customer experience. Prospective buyers are encouraged to carefully consider both positive and negative reviews before making a purchase decision."

 Great deal from Amazon and superb quality. Received all 3 trolleys fantastic condition without any damage. Just 1 thing, the colour of smallest trolley is not same as the other 2.
 Ok
 Its supereb but light scratches other then tht its light weight good one 😊 go for it but outer packing was worst hope the send it in good packing
 It is so much big than I expected as it is very wide. But felt like it could be easily damaged when suddenly fallen because the material is so sensitive. Wheels are so free to move the bag.
 

 I liked the trolley it was in a good condition, the colour is calming and elegant, best for the travel purpose as it is quite spacious, totally satisfied and on the top delivered within two three days, Thankyou amazon🙂
 Love the color of this! It's beautiful and light weight and quite sturdy. Also has good amount of space to fit in lot of clothes and accessories. Got it in lighting deal! A lot cheaper compared to outside showrooms. Highly recommend buying it online.
 I have bought two of them. They were transported to my door in all good condition.
 Colour was awesome but Some where scratches was there,so satisfaction was not upto level.and that's why you sell these products at this much discount.This is because of defective item
 Little bit scratches on it...but looks nice...
 This is the best light weight bag , durability is great and value for money 👌
 The product is very good looking, light weight n strong. But the inside zip was broken.
 Nice bag, has warranty card inside. Its light weight and looks good but Not that strong.
 Proper locking key with number reset button should be attached with this product.
 

 A good looking handy trolley with cool colour. I like this product since its quite spacious with great durability as I have used this before, so ordered another one.
 Dimensions Height of the actual suitcase is 44cms Height with wheels 53cms Width of the suitcase is 23 cms Very durable Light weight Easy to carry Can be used as cabin bag Go for it
 Actual size is 54x30x77cms No mesh inside.
 Light weight, easy to managed. Good to go for travel.
 It is amazing, exactly the same colour. Its big enough The material used inside is not that good...overall its perfect
 The media could not be loaded. Product has scratches..replace the product with new one ..do cross check.before sending product to customers
 Thank you Amazon.. Such a nice product..
 Not satisfied with this product,
 Height is good for me I needed something small Also very pretty color Quite unique Value for money
 This product is listed as 80cms in the product description. label says it's 79cms and same label says again it's 54X30X77. The actual measurements are 51X30X70. So it's not 80cms it's actually 70cms. Product quality is good. Chains are stuck a bit. Warranty says 3 years but in product description it says 5 years.So just don't go by the words in the description. If you are ready pay for less size for same price then it's ok for you. I am returning this product.
 Wheels very light and not properly working and warranty card not stampede
 Good product
 This is the first and last time I am going to buy this product. Such a waste of money.
 Good quality product !
 The product is good.. But please try to ensure the size with what you ordered. I got 55cms Instead of 67 cms.
 Very nice product. Nice colour. Sufficient capacity .and looking very nice. Easy to use.
 The media could not be loaded. I would say just buy it. I bought it in 2600.

 The media could not be loaded. Very disappointed. Didn't expect such poor quality. Strong recommend against buying it. Service centre asking for payment for repairing. Just one trip and this happened. Got it on Jan 27th on 8th Feb this is visible.
 Was reading many reviews about how they received damaged products. Hence sharing the pic, product was in prime condition as can be seen and had a seal too. The color is quite unique and has 2 compartments for wet clothes too. Best buy- 3235 bcz of discount !!
 I love the colour of this trolley set. Worth buying 👍
 I had ordered a set of 3 mint turquoise bags, of which only 2 (medium n small) were mint turquoise And 1 large bag was grey.. The picture n description said set of 3 mint turquoise.. I can’t even return it coz I’m flying on Wednesday.. I’m very disappointed
 Usage of 9 days and the bag is chipped. And to be honest I was carring clothes and other important stuff in it. I wasn't playing with it in the journey. Very bad quality. Not expected from SKYBAHS. Plz don't buy this bad from here. An unsatisfied customer.

 Beautiful product
 The quality of suitcase is impeccable however the actual dimensions of it are 54X30X77 and not 55X33X80 as mentioned by the seller which is why I'm returning it.
 Nice product. Value for money.
 The product is entirely different from the which I purched.
 Their is no option of change or reset password. Looks like duplicate. Very disappointed.
 Awesome

 I had ordered a set of 3 mint turquoise bags, of which only 2 (medium n small) were mint turquoise And 1 large bag was grey.. The picture n description said set of 3 mint turquoise.. I can’t even return it coz I’m flying on Wednesday.. I’m very disappointed
 Usage of 9 days and the bag is chipped. And to be honest I was carring clothes and other important stuff in it. I wasn't playing with it in the journey. Very bad quality. Not expected from SKYBAHS. Plz don't buy this bad from here. An unsatisfied customer.

 The quality of suitcase is impeccable however the actual dimensions of it are 54X30X77 and not 55X33X80 as mentioned by the seller which is why I'm returning it.
 Nice product. Value for money.

 Great deal from Amazon and superb quality. Received all 3 trolleys fantastic condition without any damage. Just 1 thing, the colour of smallest trolley is not same as the other 2.
 Ok
 Its supereb but light scratches other then tht its light weight good one 😊 go for it but outer packing was worst hope the send it in good packing
 It is so much big than I expected as it is very wide. But felt like it could be easily damaged when suddenly fallen because the material is so sensitive. Wheels are so free to move the bag.
 

 I liked the trolley it was in a good condition, the colour is calming and elegant, best for the travel purpose as it is quite spacious, totally satisfied and on the top delivered within two three days, Thankyou amazon🙂
 Love the color of this! It's beautiful and light weight and quite sturdy. Also has good amount of space to fit in lot of clothes and accessories. Got it in lighting deal! A lot cheaper compared to outside showrooms. Highly recommend buying it online.
 I have bought two of them. They were transported to my door in all good condition.
 Colour was awesome but Some where scratches was there,so satisfaction was not upto level.and that's why you sell these products at this much discount.This is because of defective item
 Little bit scratches on it...but looks nice...
 This is the best light weight bag , durability is great and value for money 👌
 The product is very good looking, light weight n strong. But the inside zip was broken.
 Nice bag, has warranty card inside. Its light weight and looks good but Not that strong.
 Proper locking key with number reset button should be attached with this product.
 

 A good looking handy trolley with cool colour. I like this product since its quite spacious with great durability as I have used this before, so ordered another one.
 Dimensions Height of the actual suitcase is 44cms Height with wheels 53cms Width of the suitcase is 23 cms Very durable Light weight Easy to carry Can be used as cabin bag Go for it
 Actual size is 54x30x77cms No mesh inside.
 Light weight, easy to managed. Good to go for travel.
 It is amazing, exactly the same colour. Its big enough The material used inside is not that good...overall its perfect
 The media could not be loaded. Product has scratches..replace the product with new one ..do cross check.before sending product to customers
 Thank you Amazon.. Such a nice product..
 Not satisfied with this product,
 Height is good for me I needed something small Also very pretty color Quite unique Value for money
 This product is listed as 80cms in the product description. label says it's 79cms and same label says again it's 54X30X77. The actual measurements are 51X30X70. So it's not 80cms it's actually 70cms. Product quality is good. Chains are stuck a bit. Warranty says 3 years but in product description it says 5 years.So just don't go by the words in the description. If you are ready pay for less size for same price then it's ok for you. I am returning this product.
 Wheels very light and not properly working and warranty card not stampede
 Good product
 This is the first and last time I am going to buy this product. Such a waste of money.
 Good quality product !
 The product is good.. But please try to ensure the size with what you ordered. I got 55cms Instead of 67 cms.
 Very nice product. Nice colour. Sufficient capacity .and looking very nice. Easy to use.
 The media could not be loaded. I would say just buy it. I bought it in 2600.

Positive aspects include the creamy texture, moisturizing effect, and vibrant pigmentation. Users appreciate the wide range of shades suitable for different skin tones and occasions. However, challenges arise in the areas of longevity, smudge-proof claims, and occasional discrepancies in color expectations. Some customers report receiving damaged or broken products, while others praise the product's performance and value for money. The creamy texture and pleasant fragrance receive positive mentions, but users are divided on the effectiveness of the matte finish. It is advisable for potential buyers to consider individual preferences and expectations, taking into account both positive and negative reviews, before making a purchase decision."
